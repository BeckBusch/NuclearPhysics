                <h4>What are Nuclear Power Plants?</h4>
                <p>
                    Nuclear power plants harness the energy that is released when an atom splits through nuclear
                    fission. Nuclear fission occurs when a neutron is absorbed into the nucleus of an atom, usually
                    uranium-235, causing the atom to split into two smaller atoms while releasing three neutrons,
                    several gamma rays, and a large amount of energy. This energy is used to heat up large volumes of
                    water, which spin turbines that generate electricity. The three neurons that are released are able
                    to continue on and cause more fission reactions. This creates a chain reaction which creates lots of
                    energy very fast.

                <h4>What are Control Rods?</h4>
                <p>
                    Control rods are a safety feature in power plants that allows workers to slow down or stop the
                    reaction by absorbing the neutrons without continuing the chain reaction.
                    Materials that are not fissile are introduced into the reactor which absorb the neutrons.
                    Because they are not fissile, the collision with the neutron does not cause another fission
                    reaction, and those neutrons do not contribute to the chain reaction.
                    The materials that these rods are made out of are chosen based on their ability to absorb neutrons,
                    which is quantified using the neutron capture cross-section.
                    This is the cross area of an atom that can absorb neutrons. A common choice for control rods is
                    boron.
                    Boron has a large neutron capture cross section, but because of the way that it's elementary form
                    behaves, it is used in alloys, such as high boron steel.
                    <br><br>
                    There is one important trait of nuclear fission that allows control rods to be effective.
                    If neutrons could react with atoms adjacent to the atom that released them, then the control rods
                    would somehow have to be placed in between the individual atoms of fuel.
                    Luckily, this is not the case as neutrons cannot react as soon as they are released.
                    When Nuclear fission releases neutrons, they have a lot of energy, and are moving at very fast
                    speeds.
                    However the likelihood of a reaction occuring depends on the amount of energy the neutron has, the
                    less energy it has, the higher the chance that it will trigger a fission reaction.
                    This means that until the neutrons have expended some of their energy by travelling away from the
                    fuel rod that they came from, they will not react.
                    This makes them travel through the space inbetween the fuel rods and allows them to be intercepted
                    by a control rod.

                <h4>How do Containment Systems Work?</h4>
                <p>
                    Between the gamma radiation, radioactive fuel, and high pressure steam, nuclear reactors have a lot
                    of dangers that they need to protect against. The ideology for protecting against exposure or leaks
                    is ‘Defence in Depth’, containing the nuclear reaction with four different systems.
                    <br>
                    The first is the ceramic fuel pellets. Instead of using elemental uranium in the reactor, uranium
                    dioxide is used, as its physical properties are favourable. Not only is its melting point much
                    higher (2865°C vs 1132°C), because its already an oxide, it can’t burn. This drastically reduces
                    complications. To create these pellets, uranium trioxide is reacted with hydrogen to form uranium
                    oxide. The uranium oxide is then pressed into pellets, and sintered to form a ceramic.
                    <br>
                    The second system is the fuel rods themselves. The fuel pellets are stacked and then sealed in
                    tubes, along with coolant. These tubes are made of zirconium alloys, which are very corrosion
                    resistant and have a low neutron capture area. The corrosion resistance prevents the fuel from
                    leaking, while the low neutron capture area stops the neutrons interacting with something that’s not
                    designed to control or limit the reaction.
                    <img class="img" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Kernkraftwerk_Grafenrheinfeld_-_2013.jpg">
                    <br>
                    The final containment system is the containment building. When people think of a nuclear power
                    plant, they imagine a large hyperbolic structure. This structure does not contain the reactor, but
                    rather, is just a water cooling tower. The reactor is actually contained within a cylindrical
                    building, built to contain high pressure steam, or radioactive gas in the case of an emergency.
                    Although some are made with lead, the most common designs use concrete reinforced with steel. This
                    is because the containment building doesn’t need lead to block radiation, but rather high strength
                    steel to contain steam pressure.
