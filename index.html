                <h4>What are Nuclear Power Plants?</h4>
                <p>
                    Nuclear power plants harness the energy that is released when an atom splits through nuclear
                    fission. Nuclear fission occurs when a neutron is absorbed into the nucleus of an atom, usually
                    uranium-235, causing the atom to split into two smaller atoms while releasing three neutrons,
                    several gamma rays, and a large amount of energy. This energy is used to heat up large volumes of
                    water, which spin turbines that generate electricity. The three neurons that are released are able
                    to continue on and cause more fission reactions. This creates a chain reaction which creates lots of
                    energy very fast.

                <h4>What are Control Rods?</h4>
                <p>
                    Control rods are a safety feature in power plants that allows workers to slow down or stop the
                    reaction by absorbing the neutrons without continuing the chain reaction. Materials that are not
                    fissile are introduced into the reactor which absorb the neutrons. Because they are not fissile, the
                    collision with the neutron does not cause another fission reaction, and those neutrons do not
                    contribute to the chain reaction. The materials that these rods are made out of are chosen based on
                    their ability to absorb neutrons, which is quantified using the neutron capture cross-section. This
                    is the cross area of an atom that can absorb neutrons. A common choice for control rods is boron.
                    Boron has a large neutron capture cross section, but because of the way that it's elementary form
                    behaves, it is used in alloys, such as high boron steel.
                    <br><br>
                    There is one important trait of nuclear fission that allows control rods to be effective. If
                    neutrons could react with atoms adjacent to the atom that released them, then the control rods would
                    somehow have to be placed in between the individual atoms of fuel. Luckily, this is not the case as
                    neutrons cannot react as soon as they are released. When Nuclear fission releases neutrons, they
                    have a lot of energy, and are moving at very fast speeds. However the likelihood of a reaction
                    occuring depends on the amount of energy the neutron has, the less energy it has the higher the
                    chance it will trigger a fission reaction. This means that until the neutrons have expended some of
                    their energy by travelling away from the fuel rod that they came from, they will not react. This
                    makes them travel through the space inbetween the fuel rods and allows them to be intercepted by a
                    control rod.

                <h4>How do Containment Systems Work?</h4>
                <p>
                    Between the gamma radiation, radioactive fuel, and high pressure steam, nuclear reactors have a lot
                    of dangers that they need to protect against. The ideology for protecting against exposure or leaks
                    is ‘Defence in Depth’, containing the nuclear reaction with four different systems.
                    <br>
                    The first is the ceramic fuel pellets. Instead of using elemental uranium in the reactor, uranium
                    dioxide is used, as its physical properties are favourable. Not only is its melting point much
                    higher (2865°C vs 1132°C), because its already an oxide, it can’t burn. This drastically reduces
                    complications. To create these pellets, uranium trioxide is reacted with hydrogen to form uranium
                    oxide. The uranium oxide is then pressed into pellets, and sintered to form a ceramic. Sintering is
                    a process where the powder is heated up to near-melting. This causes it to join together and form a
                    solid without needing to melt.
                    <br>
                    The second system is the fuel rods themselves. The fuel pellets are stacked and then sealed in
                    tubes, along with coolant. These tubes are made of zirconium alloys, which are very corrosion
                    resistant and have a low neutron capture area. The corrosion resistance prevents the fuel from
                    leaking, while the low neutron capture area stops the neutrons interacting with something that’s not
                    designed to control or limit the reaction.
                    <img class="img"
                         src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Kernkraftwerk_Grafenrheinfeld_-_2013.jpg">
                    <br>
                    The final containment system is the containment building. When people think of a nuclear power
                    plant, they imagine a large hyperbolic structure. This structure does not contain the reactor, but
                    rather, is just a water cooling tower. The reactor is actually contained within a cylindrical
                    building, built to contain high pressure steam, or radioactive gas in the case of an emergency.
                    Although some are made with lead, the most common designs use concrete reinforced with steel. This
                    is because the containment building doesn’t need lead to block radiation, but rather high strength
                    steel to contain steam pressure.
                </p>

                <h4>How does Water Cooling Work?</h4>
                <p>
                    The majority of the worlds nuclear power plants are light water reactors. The phrase ‘light water’
                    means that the plant uses normal water instead of heavy water, which is water with hydrogen atoms
                    that have extra neutrons. There are three types of light water reactors; pressurized water reactors,
                    boiling water reactors, and supercritical water reactors, the latter being far less common than the
                    first two.
                    <br>
                    Any atoms in close proximity to radiation have the potential to absorb neutrons into their nucleus.
                    When this happens, the atom can become unstable and emit these extra neutrons into the environment
                    at predictable but ultimately random intervals. The large amount of water in a nuclear power plant
                    are highly susceptible to absorbing neutrons and therefore large quantities of oxygen turn into
                    nitrogen-16, a radioactive isotope that decays after 7 seconds to release a deadly gamma ray.
                    <br>
                    Nitrogen-16 is responsible for one of the main flaws in boiling water reactors. Boiling waters pump
                    water into the reactor core to the turned into steam. This steam then exits the reactor core and is
                    taken through pipes to turbines, which are turned to generate electricity. The problem is, the
                    highly radioactive nitrogen-16 has to be transported around the entire system. This means that
                    almost all the pipes and turbine parts need to be resistant to radiation. The answer to this problem
                    is pressurised water reactors. Pressurized water reactors use two water systems to contain the water
                    that gets exposed to radiation. Just like BWRs, water is pumped into the reactor core to be heated.
                    The difference is that this heated water is then used to heat more water while remaining in its
                    pipes. This way the reactor can boil water while not creating large amounts of radioactive water.

                <h4>What is a Meltdown?</h4>
                <p>
                    A nuclear meltdown is a severe accident that results from the core overheating and, as the name
                    suggests, melting. If the nuclear fuel gets to the point where the cooling system can't cool it fast
                    enough it will continue heating until it destroys the zirconium casing of the fuel rod and leaks
                    out. The zirconium metal can, at such high temperatures, react with the uranium dioxide used as fuel
                    to form metallic uranium.
                    <br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;Zr + UO2 → ZrO2 + U
                    <br>
                    Among other things, this lowers the melting point to the fuel, allowing it to leak out of the fuel
                    rods and into the reactor. The now molten fuel will then continue to melt through most layers of the
                    reactor, eventually interacting with the liquid coolant. This is very dangerous as the steam created
                    can leak contaminants into the environment. Eventually the molten fuel will become corium; a
                    lava-like mixture of many things in the reactor such as fuel, fission products, different metals,
                    and even concrete. This mixture creates an eutectic system, meaning that melting point of the
                    mixture is lower than the melting point of many of the individual substances. Because of this, it
                    will stay liquid for longer and pose a much greater risk to leaking radioactive substances into the
                    surrounding environment.
                </p>
                <h4>What is a Steam Explosion?</h4>
                <p>
                    A steam explosion is when water is boiled into steam in such extreme conditions, that the speed of
                    the phase change (boiling from liquid to gas) creates an explosion similar to a combustion
                    explosion. Although the heat and fire are damaging in a combustion explosion, the majority of the
                    structural damage is caused by the rapid expansion of the gas or liquid. This rapid expansion is
                    just as present in a steam explosion. The extreme pressure created by such an explosion can damage
                    containment units and pressure chambers. This causes large cracks in structures, allowing
                    radioactive material to escape. Another danger is the steam itself. Hydrogen can form many
                    radioactive isotopes, and most of them are able to still form water. An isotope is an atom that has
                    extra neutrons in its nucleus. Because these extra neutrons make the atom unstable, it will
                    periodically release them into the environment as radiation. The water in a power plant has high
                    exposure to the radioactive core and radioactive hydrogen is very common. If water made from
                    radioactive hydrogen escapes from the reactor and floats away as steam, it can have a large impact
                    on the surrounding environment.
                </p>
                <h4>How does a Hydrogen Explosion Occur?</h4>
                <p>
                    Zirconium alloys, or Zircaloys, are very popular in nuclear power plants as fuel rod casing. This is
                    because they have a very low neutron capture cross-section, and are very unlikely to interfere with
                    the neutrons emitted from the fuel within the rods. However metallic zirconium has a big
                    disadvantage. At temperatures of above 1200°C, zirconium will react exothermically with water to
                    oxidise, and produce free hydrogen gas.
                    <br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;Zr + 2 H2O → ZrO2 + 2 H2
                    <br>
                    Not only does this reaction create hydrogen gas, but also it provides more heat to facilitate more
                    reactions. The large amount of hydrogen gas produced is extremely combustible, forming explosive
                    mixtures in air with as little as 4% concentration, that can be ignited by small amounts of heat,
                    something that is definitely not is short supply in the middle of a meltdown.
                    The resulting explosion can severely damage containment buildings and cause large amounts of
                    radioactive material to leak into the surrounding environment. This occured in reactors 1, 2, and 3
                    of the Fukushima disaster.
