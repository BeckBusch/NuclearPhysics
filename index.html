                <p style="font-size:135%;">Because nuclear power plants constantly deal with large amounts of radiation, heat and toxic material, let alone a sustained fission reaction, several design elements are needed to control these dangers.</p>

                <h4>Control Rods</h4>
                <p>
                    Control rods are a safety feature in power plants that allows workers to slow down or stop the reaction by absorbing the neutrons without continuing the chain reaction.
                    Materials that are not fissile are introduced into the reactor which absorb the neutrons.
                    Because they are not fissile, the collision with the neutron does not cause another fission reaction, and those neutrons do not contribute to the chain reaction.
                    The materials that these rods are made out of are chosen based on their ability to absorb neutrons, which is quantified using the neutron capture cross-section.
                    This is the cross area of an atom that can absorb neutrons. A common choice for control rods is boron.
                    Boron has a large neutron capture cross section, but because of the way that it's elementary form behaves, it is used in alloys, such as high boron steel.
                    <br><br>
                    There is one important trait of nuclear fission that allows control rods to be effective.
                    If neutrons could react with atoms adjacent to the atom that released them, then the control rods would somehow have to be placed in between the individual atoms of fuel.
                    Luckily, this is not the case as neutrons cannot react as soon as they are released.
                    When Nuclear fission releases neutrons, they have a lot of energy, and are moving at very fast speeds.
                    However the likelihood of a reaction occuring depends on the amount of energy the neutron has, the less energy the higher the chance.
                    This means that until the neutrons have expended some of their energy by travelling away from the fuel rod that they came from, they will not react.
                    This makes them travel through the space inbetween the fuel rods and allows them to be intercepted by a control rod.
