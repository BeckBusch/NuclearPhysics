                <h4>What are Nuclear Power Plants?</h4>
                <p>
                    Nuclear power plants harness the energy that is released when an atom splits through nuclear
                    fission. Nuclear fission occurs when a neutron is absorbed into the nucleus of an atom, usually
                    uranium-235, causing the atom to split into two smaller atoms while releasing three neutrons,
                    several gamma rays, and a large amount of energy. This energy is used to heat up large volumes of
                    water, which spin turbines that generate electricity. The three neurons that are released are able
                    to continue on and cause more fission reactions. This creates a chain reaction which creates lots of
                    energy very fast.
                </p>

                <h4>What are Control Rods?</h4>
                <p>
                    Control rods are a safety feature in power plants that allows workers to slow down or stop the
                    reaction by absorbing the neutrons without continuing the chain reaction. Materials that are not
                    fissile are introduced into the reactor which absorb the neutrons. Because they are not fissile, the
                    collision with the neutron does not cause another fission reaction, and those neutrons do not
                    contribute to the chain reaction. The materials that these rods are made out of are chosen based on
                    their ability to absorb neutrons, which is quantified using the neutron capture cross-section. This
                    is the cross area of an atom that can absorb neutrons. A common choice for control rods is boron.
                    Boron has a large neutron capture cross section, but because of the way that it's elementary form
                    behaves, it is used in alloys, such as high boron steel.<span class="link">[1]</span>
                    <br><br>
                    There is one important trait of nuclear fission that allows control rods to be effective. If
                    neutrons could react with atoms adjacent to the atom that released them, then the control rods would
                    somehow have to be placed in between the individual atoms of fuel. Luckily, this is not the case as
                    neutrons cannot react as soon as they are released. When Nuclear fission releases neutrons, they
                    have a lot of energy, and are moving at very fast speeds. However the likelihood of a reaction
                    occuring depends on the amount of energy the neutron has, the less energy it has the higher the
                    chance it will trigger a fission reaction. This means that until the neutrons have expended some of
                    their energy by travelling away from the fuel rod that they came from, they will not react. This
                    makes them travel through the space inbetween the fuel rods and allows them to be intercepted by a
                    control rod.<span class="link">[2]</span>

                <h4>How do Containment Systems Work?</h4>
                <p>
                    Between the gamma radiation, radioactive fuel, and high pressure steam, nuclear reactors have a lot
                    of dangers that they need to protect against. The ideology for protecting against exposure or leaks
                    is ‘Defence in Depth’, containing the nuclear reaction with four different systems.<span
                        class="link">[3]</span>
                    <br>
                    The first is the ceramic fuel pellets. Instead of using elemental uranium in the reactor, uranium
                    dioxide is used, as its physical properties are favourable. Not only is its melting point much
                    higher (2865°C vs 1132°C), because its already an oxide, it can’t burn. This drastically reduces
                    complications. To create these pellets, uranium trioxide is reacted with hydrogen to form uranium
                    oxide. The uranium oxide is then pressed into pellets, and sintered to form a ceramic.<span
                        class="link">[4]</span> Sintering is
                    a process where the powder is heated up to near-melting. This causes it to join together and form a
                    solid without needing to melt.
                    <br>
                    The second system is the fuel rods themselves. The fuel pellets are stacked and then sealed in
                    tubes, along with coolant. These tubes are made of zirconium alloys, which are very corrosion
                    resistant and have a low neutron capture area. The corrosion resistance prevents the fuel from
                    leaking, while the low neutron capture area stops the neutrons interacting with something that’s not
                    designed to control or limit the reaction.<span class="link">[5]</span>

                    <br>
                    The final containment system is the containment building. When people think of a nuclear power
                    plant, they imagine a large hyperbolic structure. This structure does not contain the reactor, but
                    rather, is just a water cooling tower. The reactor is actually contained within a cylindrical
                    building, built to contain high pressure steam, or radioactive gas in the case of an emergency.
                    Although some are made with lead, the most common designs use concrete reinforced with steel.<span
                        class="link">[3]</span> This
                    is because the containment building doesn’t need lead to block radiation, but rather high strength
                    steel to contain steam pressure.
                </p>
                <h4>What Actually Contains the Reaction Itself?</h4>
                <p>
                    The third layer of defence is the Reactor Pressure Vessel. This is where the reaction itself occurs,
                    so the vessel needs to be able to withstand one of the most extreme environments sustained on earth.
                    To resist corrosion, the parts of the vessel that are in contact with the coolant are made from
                    stainless steel with a high chromium content. The main body of the vessel is constructed from plate
                    steel with a high nickel content. Nickel and chromium are important in the vessel because they have
                    a high heat and pressure resistance, making them resistant to shock.
                    <img class="img" id="contain"
                         src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Shippingport_LOC_135430pu.jpg">h
                    <br>
                    Corrosion is a big problem in the pressure vessel because the metal is constantly being bombarded
                    with high energy particles. When these particles hit atoms in the steel, they can transfer their
                    energy and knock the atom out of the lattis, creating defects in the metal which can turn into
                    cracks, which isn’t the best thing to have in a pressure vessel.<span class="link">[23]</span>
                </p>
                <h4>How does Water Cooling Work?</h4>
                <p>
                    The majority of the worlds nuclear power plants are light water reactors. The phrase ‘light water’
                    means that the plant uses normal water instead of heavy water, which is water with hydrogen atoms
                    that have extra neutrons. There are three types of light water reactors; pressurized water reactors,
                    boiling water reactors, and supercritical water reactors, the latter being far less common than the
                    first two.<span class="link">[6]</span>
                    <br>
                    Any atoms in close proximity to radiation have the potential to absorb neutrons into their nucleus.
                    When this happens, the atom can become unstable and emit these extra neutrons into the environment
                    at predictable but ultimately random intervals. The large amount of water in a nuclear power plant
                    are highly susceptible to absorbing neutrons and therefore large quantities of oxygen turn into
                    nitrogen-16, a radioactive isotope that decays after 7 seconds to release a deadly gamma ray.<span
                        class="link">[7]</span>
                    <br>
                    Nitrogen-16 is responsible for one of the main flaws in boiling water reactors. Boiling waters pump
                    water into the reactor core to the turned into steam. This steam then exits the reactor core and is
                    taken through pipes to turbines, which are turned to generate electricity. The problem is, the
                    highly radioactive nitrogen-16 has to be transported around the entire system. This means that
                    almost all the pipes and turbine parts need to be resistant to radiation. The answer to this problem
                    is pressurised water reactors. Pressurized water reactors use two water systems to contain the water
                    that gets exposed to radiation. Just like BWRs, water is pumped into the reactor core to be heated.
                    The difference is that this heated water is then used to heat more water while remaining in its
                    pipes. This way the reactor can boil water while not creating large amounts of radioactive
                    water.<span class="link">[6]</span>

                <h4>What is a Meltdown?</h4>
                <p>
                    A nuclear meltdown is a severe accident that results from the core overheating and, as the name
                    suggests, melting. If the nuclear fuel gets to the point where the cooling system can't cool it fast
                    enough it will continue heating until it destroys the zirconium casing of the fuel rod and leaks
                    out. The zirconium metal can, at such high temperatures, react with the uranium dioxide used as fuel
                    to form metallic uranium.
                    <br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;Zr + UO2 → ZrO2 + U&emsp;<span class="link">[8]</span>
                    <br>
                    Among other things, this lowers the melting point to the fuel, allowing it to leak out of the fuel
                    rods and into the reactor. The now molten fuel will then continue to melt through most layers of the
                    reactor, eventually interacting with the liquid coolant. This is very dangerous as the steam created
                    can leak contaminants into the environment. Eventually the molten fuel will become corium; a
                    lava-like mixture of many things in the reactor such as fuel, fission products, different metals,
                    and even concrete. This mixture creates an eutectic system, meaning that melting point of the
                    mixture is lower than the melting point of many of the individual substances. Because of this, it
                    will stay liquid for longer and pose a much greater risk to leaking radioactive substances into the
                    surrounding environment.<span class="link">[9]</span>
                </p>
                <h4>What is a Steam Explosion?</h4>
                <p>
                    A steam explosion is when water is boiled into steam in such extreme conditions, that the speed of
                    the phase change (boiling from liquid to gas) creates an explosion similar to a combustion
                    explosion. Although the heat and fire are damaging in a combustion explosion, the majority of the
                    structural damage is caused by the rapid expansion of the gas or liquid. This rapid expansion is
                    just as present in a steam explosion. The extreme pressure created by such an explosion can damage
                    containment units and pressure chambers. This causes large cracks in structures, allowing
                    radioactive material to escape. Another danger is the steam itself. Hydrogen can form many
                    radioactive isotopes, and most of them are able to still form water. An isotope is an atom that has
                    extra neutrons in its nucleus. Because these extra neutrons make the atom unstable, it will
                    periodically release them into the environment as radiation. The water in a power plant has high
                    exposure to the radioactive core and radioactive hydrogen is very common. If water made from
                    radioactive hydrogen escapes from the reactor and floats away as steam, it can have a large impact
                    on the surrounding environment.<span class="link">[10]</span>
                </p>
                <img class="img" id="explode"
                     src="https://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01847/japan-fire_1847194i.jpg">
                <h4>How does a Hydrogen Explosion Occur?</h4>
                <p>
                    Zirconium alloys, or Zircaloys, are very popular in nuclear power plants as fuel rod casing. This is
                    because they have a very low neutron capture cross-section, and are very unlikely to interfere with
                    the neutrons emitted from the fuel within the rods. However metallic zirconium has a big
                    disadvantage. At temperatures of above 1200°C, zirconium will react exothermically with water to
                    oxidise, and produce free hydrogen gas.
                    <br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;Zr + 2 H2O → ZrO2 + 2 H2&emsp;<span class="link">[8]</span>
                    <br>
                    Not only does this reaction create hydrogen gas, but also it provides more heat to facilitate more
                    reactions. The large amount of hydrogen gas produced is extremely combustible, forming explosive
                    mixtures in air with as little as 4% concentration, that can be ignited by small amounts of heat,
                    something that is definitely not is short supply in the middle of a meltdown.<span
                        class="link">[11]</span>
                    The resulting explosion can severely damage containment buildings and cause large amounts of
                    radioactive material to leak into the surrounding environment. This occured in reactors 1, 2, and 3
                    of the Fukushima disaster.<span class="link">[12]</span>

                <h4>What is a Criticality Accident?</h4>
                <p>
                    In nuclear physics, a mass of nuclear material is said to be in a critical state when its fission
                    chain reaction is self sustaining. This occurs when the conditions are right for the neutrons
                    emitted by the reaction to cause another reaction in the same mass of material, allowing the fission
                    reaction to continue inside the middle of the material. Although there are several factors that can
                    cause criticality, the two most common factors are the size of the mass, and neutron reflection.
                    Because neutrons need to travel a certain distance to lose energy before they can react, having a
                    larger mass increases the possibility that a neutron will still be inside the mass of material when
                    it is able to react.<span class="link">[13]</span>
                    <br>
                    Neutron reflection will also cause criticality in fissile material. By using materials such as
                    beryllium, you can reflect the neutrons emitted by the material back at the material. This means
                    that almost every neutron produced will go on to create another reaction. A two famous examples of
                    criticality accidents caused by neutron reflection are the deaths of Louis Slotin and Harry
                    Daghlian. Although they were killed by two different experiments, both involved using beryllium to
                    investigate criticality. Ironically the same radiation source was used in both experiments, a 6
                    kilogram sphere of plutonium aptly nicknamed the ‘Demon Core’, after causing the deaths of two
                    people. The design of the core meant that it was always 95% critical so that it would be easy for
                    scientists to achieve criticality for an experiment.<span class="link">[15]</span> Louis Slotins
                    experiment involved containing
                    the core between two hemispheres of beryllium. The problem occured when Louis broke safety
                    regulations and used the blade of a screwdriver to separate the hemispheres instead of the provided
                    spacers. When the screwdriver fell out, the gap between the hemispheres was closed and the beryllium
                    started to reflect all of the neutrons, causing the core to go critical.<span
                        class="link">[14]</span> When a nuclear mass becomes
                    critical it emits neutron radiation, a form of ionising radiation as free neutrons. This radiation
                    is extremely deadly to all forms of life. Louis was able to separate the hemispheres before the
                    radiation became powerful enough to effect the 7 other people in the room, but not before he
                    received a lethal dose of radiation himself.

                <h4>What is a Dosimeter Badge?</h4>
                <p>
                    A dosimeter badge, sometimes called a film badge, is a badge made for people working in close
                    proximity to radiation. When providing medical care to someone who is suffering from radiation
                    poisoning or a similar illness, knowing the intensity of the radiation dose they received is very
                    helpful and allows you to make better decisions. A dosimeter badge works in a similar way to the
                    film in a camera, in fact, the same type of film is used. Photographic film of varying grain size is
                    placed into a plastic case behind several different metal filters. These metal filters are able to
                    block certain types of radiation in some areas of the film, allowing for a more detailed reading of
                    radiation exposure. The badge also contains a form of ID. This allows the badge to be used as a
                    security badge while linking the readings from the badge to the person wearing it. When the film is
                    read, it is removed from the plastic case to be developed. Because the film is photographic film it
                    must be stored, even when sitting in the case, in a light protective packet. The film is developed
                    in a dark room with similar techniques used to develop photographs, and the radiation is recorded
                    based on the intensity of the ‘images’ that appear on each section of the film.<span class="link">[16]</span>

                <h4>How do Respiration Masks Work?</h4>
                <p>
                    Although powerful rays of ionizing radiation are very harmful, it is more common to sustain damage
                    from small airborne particles of radioactive material. Ionising alpha radiation can be emitted by
                    tiny flakes of radioactive material.<span class="link">[17]</span> Alpha particles (when produced by
                    radioactive decay) have a low
                    penetration strength, and are able to be stopped by a few centimeters of air or just skin.<span
                        class="link">[18]</span> But if
                    the tiny particles of radioactive material were they to be inhaled, they could settle in the lungs
                    and emit radiation right next to the body's most important and delicate organs. Because the
                    radioactive particles released by the material have low penetration strengths, respiration equipment
                    does not need to shield against radiation using metals like lead. Instead they just need to filter
                    out dust and small particles, making them no different from the respiration equipment used in other
                    industries. Ironically one of the most important pieces of radiation protection has very little to
                    do with radiation in particular.

                <h4>How are Radiation suits Designed?</h4>
                <p>
                    Most forms of radiation protection are designed off the fact that radioactive particles are able to
                    damage human cells due to their large amount of energy. If the energy of these particles can be
                    removed, then they will pose little to no threat to the body. This is simple enough to do with weak
                    forms of radiation such as x-rays. Lead aprons are used around x-ray machines to protect vulnerable
                    parts of the body, or to protect doctors who have longer exposure.<span class="link">[19]</span> As
                    the x-rays pass through the
                    lead, the high density and electron count of the metal dissipate the energy of the x-rays and stop
                    them dealing damage.<span class="link">[20]</span> A relatively thin layer of lead is enough to
                    block x-rays, but it is much
                    harder to protect against the higher energy gamma rays. The best gamma protection available is the
                    ‘StemRad 360 Gamma’. The 360 Gamma is a cross between a vest and a belt, designed to protect the
                    body from radiation poisoning.<span class="link">[21]</span> While the shield covers a small amount
                    of the body compared to a full
                    apron, it is designed to fully protect the pelvis bone. This is because humans suffer the most
                    damage when radiation effects the bone marrow and stops the production of blood cells. By protecting
                    the pelvis, a large amount of marrow can be protected, allowing the body to naturally regenerate the
                    rest of the bone marrow.<span class="link">[22]</span>

                <h4>What is Radiation Poisoning?</h4>
                <p>
                    Acute Radiation Syndrome, commonly called radiation poisoning, is the name given to a group of
                    several negative health effects that are caused by exposure to a high dose of ionising radiation.<span class="link">[24]</span>
                    Depending on the dose you receive, the results can be extremely severe and onset very quickly. For
                    example, patients receiving 2-6 grays on radiation can experience nausea and vomiting within 2
                    hours, while patients receiving 30+ grays will experience severe headaches and seizures within 1
                    hours. There are three main areas that are affected; the blood system, the nervous system, and the
                    gastrointestinal system. The blood system is damaged through aplastic anemia, which is when the bone
                    marrow is damaged leading to a drop in the amount of blood cells.<span class="link">[25]</span> This is not fatal in small doses,
                    but can complicate other infuries like burns or cuts, because there aren’t enough white blood cells
                    to heal the body. Aplastic anemia occurs when the radiation damages the bone marrow. The bone marrow
                    is particularly vulnerable because it is all over the body and close under the skin, making it an
                    easy target for radiation with low penetration strength. Gastrointestinal symptoms are common
                    because the body's digestive system involves many small parts. These are particularly vulnerable to
                    radiation because a smaller amount of cells being damaged has a larger effect.
                    <br>
                    By far the most fatal symptoms are neurovascular. Due to how delicate the brain is, and how wide
                    spread the nervous system is, when receiving high doses of radiation neurovascular damage is common.
                    Neurovascular damage almost always leads to death after seizures, ataxia and loss of consciousness.
                    When ionising radiation is able to kill important cells in the brain, these symptoms are very easy
                    to develop and highly damaging.
                </p>
                <h4>What are Radiation Burns?</h4>
                <p>
                    Radiation burns are areas of the skin that have been damaged by radiation. ‘Burn’ is used in its
                    wider sense as ‘damage to the skin’ like with chemical or cold burns, as opposed to the more common
                    sense of heat injury.<span class="link">[26]</span> Radiation burns are actually extremely common, with millions of people each
                    year getting sunburns. Sunburns are a type of radiation burn as it is not heat, but the direct UV
                    radiation that damages the skin. Sunburn occurs when radiation from the sun penetrates the skin and
                    damages the DNA in the skin cells.<span class="link">[27]</span> This causes the cells to die from apoptosis (cell suicide) but
                    not before increasing the blood flow to the area, causing redness and a hot sensation. This hot
                    sensation is commonly misinterpreted as the skin still burning, furthering the misconception that
                    heat, not radiation, causes sunburn.
                    <br>
                    Radiation burns from stronger forms of radiation work the same way, just on a larger scale. Gamma
                    rays can penetrate much deeper into the skin, as they have more energy, causing what some describe
                    as a “three dimensional sunburn”.<span class="link">[28]</span>
                </p>
                <h4>How can you get Cancer from Radiation?</h4>
                <p>While most interactions between cells and radiation damage or destroy the cell, sometimes the cell,
                    or rather the cells DNA, can become mutated.<span class="link">[29]</span> This is when the cell is affected enough to change how
                    it works, but can still survive. This is often worse as it leads to cancer forming when the affected
                    cell reproduces at an uncontrolled rate. Radiation is said to be responsible for 10% of invasive
                    cancers.
                    <br>
                    Ionising radiation causes atoms to lose their electrons and become ions. This breaks chemical bonds
                    and changes the structure of the molecule. If the cell is changed in the right way, the cell can
                    become cancerous.
